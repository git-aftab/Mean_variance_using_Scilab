# Mean_variance_using_Scilab

#AIM: To write a program for mean, variance and cross correlation in SCILAB and verify the output.

#EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED

· Computer with i3 Processor · SCI LAB

#Algorithm

1. Define the Function: Specify the function you want to simulate. For example, f(x)=sin⁡(x)f(x) = \sin(x)f(x)=sin(x) or any other function.

2. Generate Sample Points: Decide on the range and the number of sample points. Generate these sample points within the desired range.

3. Evaluate the Function: Compute the function values at each of these sample points.

4. Compute Mean, Variance and Cross Correlation: Use Scilab's functions to calculate the mean and variance of the computed function values.

5. Display Results: Output the computed mean variance and Cross Correlation

#PROCEDURE

· Refer Algorithms and write code for the experiment.

· Open SCILAB in System

· Type your code in New Editor

· Save the file

· Execute the code

· If any Error, correct it in code and execute again

· Verify the generated results

#PROGRAM
```
//Mean Value
function X=f(x)
    z=5*(1-x)^2,
    X = x*z
endfunction 
a=3;
b=5;
EX = intg(a,b,f);
disp(EX);

//Variance
function X=g(x)
    z=3*(1-x)^2,
    X=x^2*z
endfunction
a=1;
b=3;

EX2=intg(a,b,g);
disp(EX2)


```

#OUTPUT:

i) Mean of X = 393.33333

Mean of Y = 51.200000

#Cross Correlation

Type in the reference sequence = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]

Type in the second sequence = [2 1 3 5 6 3 5 9]

#Calculation:

RESULT:

Thus the mean , variance and cross correlation are executed in Scilab and output is verified.
